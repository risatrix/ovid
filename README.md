#Ovid JSON (and API, eventually)

Inspired by the [Aeneid API](http://aeneid.eu/api/), I wanted to make an API
for my favorite Roman poet, Ovid.

##What This Is Right Now

Right now, it's just a bunch of JSON files I made based on the [XML
file I downloaded from Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/dltext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0068).

The goal of this step was twofold:
1) To create JSON that was less complex than the original XML structure
2) To create a more conistent data structure that could support multiple works.

You can read a little more about that [here](http://techintranslation.com/if-you-want-something-done-part-1-getting-ovid-into-json/).

##What It Might Become

My eventual goal is to make this into an API, which I will probably use Django for.

Until then, everyone is welcome to use the JSON etc., though the addresses may change so I wouldn't suggest using the URL for anything permanent.
